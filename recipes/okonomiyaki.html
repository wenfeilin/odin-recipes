    </p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>Main</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>100g flour</li>
      <li>100mL water (room temperature)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Hondashi (bonito dashi powder)</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>~200g shredded cabbage</li>
      <li>chopped pork belly (as much as you want)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Tonkatsu sauce</li>
      <li>Kewpie mayo</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Topping</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>bonito flakes</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix the batter: flour, water, dashi powder, and egg.</li>
      <li>
        Mix the batter with the chopped cabbage. You want the batter to bind the cabbage, not to 
        drown the cabbage in batter. The higher the cabbage to batter ratio, the tastier the 
        okonomiyaki will be.
      </li>
      <li>Spread a thin layer of cooking oil on the frying pan on medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        Spread the cabbage batter mix on the pan in a circle shape. Put pork belly on top. Cook 
        for about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the bottom is lightly brown and firm enough to flip, flip it so that the pork belly 
        touches the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower the heat to low, cover with a lid, and cook for about 5 minutes. Monitor the bottom 
        closely so that it doesn't burn!
      </li>
      <li>Once the pork belly is cooked, flip it again and make sure the other side is cooked.</li>
      <li>
        Top with tonkatsu sauce, bonito flakes, and Kewpie mayo in this order to make it look 
        pretty.
      </li>
    </ol>
